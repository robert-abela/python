# 01.Introduction to scraping
In this series of articles will go through all the steps needed to write a script that reads information from a website. Other articles in this series will cover:
* [00.Pre-requisites](00.Pre-requisites.md)
* [02.Writing a basic selenium script to get information](02.BasicSelenium.md)
* [03.Optimising the script for performance and stability](03.Optimisations.md)

This article introduces Selenium and a scraper (BeautifulSoup) detailing the process for their installation. It also discusses the difference between a simple scraper and using Selenium.

## Installing Selenium and other requirements
Selenium setup requires two steps:
1. install the Selenium library using the command: __pip install selenium__
1. download the Selenium WebDriver for your browser (exact version). Chrome drivers can be found on [chromium.org](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)

Scraper setup requires two command:
1. __pip install requests__ 
2. __pip install beautifulsoup4__

## Scraping a website
* what is scraping?

### Traditional Scraping
see: https://realpython.com/beautiful-soup-web-scraper-python/
[Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) is onother framework to consider.

### What is Selenium?
[Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) is a framework designed primarily for automated web applications testing. It allows developers to programatically control a browsers using different programming languages. 

Why is Selenium different?

### Basic scraper
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

#Visit Page and parse source HTML
page = requests.get("http://www.python.org")
soup = BeautifulSoup(page.content, 'html.parser')

#Check title is as expected
assert "Python" in soup.title.string

##Perform the search using HTTP GET request
page = requests.get( "https://www.python.org/search/?q=pip&submit=")
soup = BeautifulSoup(page.content, 'html.parser')

#Look for expected result is present
link = soup.find('a', href="/dev/peps/pep-0439/")
assert "PEP 439" in link.string
```
### Scraper using Selenium
```python
from selenium import webdriver

#Open browser and visit page
driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get("http://www.python.org")

#Check title is as expected
assert "Python" in driver.title

#Find search field
search_field = driver.find_element_by_id("id-search-field")
#Enter search term
search_field.send_keys("pip")
#Find and click the Search button
search_button = driver.find_element_by_id("submit")
search_button.click()

#Look for expected result
link = driver.find_element_by_partial_link_text("PEP 439")
#Check the link is correct
assert link.get_attribute("href") == "https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0439/"
#Close browser
driver.close()
```
