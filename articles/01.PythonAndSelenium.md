* [03.Optimising the script for performance and stability](03.Optimisations.md)

This article introduces the Selenium and Scrapy libraries and their installation process. It also discusses the difference between a simple scraper and using Selenium.

## Installing Selenium and Scrapy
Selenium setup requires two steps:
1. install the Selenium library using the command: __pip install selenium__

search_field = driver.find_element_by_id("id-search-field")
#Enter search term
search_field.send_keys("pip")
#Find and click the Search button
search_button = driver.find_element_by_id("submit")
search_button.click()
#Look for expected result
link = driver.find_element_by_partial_link_text("PEP 439")
#Check the link is correct
assert link.get_attribute("href") == "https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0439/"
#Close browser
driver.close()
```
