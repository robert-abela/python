# Introduction and setup
In this series of articles we will go through all the steps needed to write a script that reads information from a website. Other articles in this series will cover:
* [02. Writing a basic selenium script to get information](02.BasicSelenium.md)
* [03. Optimising the script for performance and stability](03.Optimisations.md)

This article introduces the basic setup required to install the corect version of Python and the Selenium library. It also discusses the difference between a simple scraper and using Selenium

## Python and Selenium
The setup assumes a Windows operating system but should be easily transferable to Mac OSX or Linux.

### Python versions
Which Python version should one use: Python 2.x or Python 3.x? This might have been a point of discussion in the past (Python 2.7 is the Latest version of Python 2.x and was released in 2010) and since the two are not compatible one had to choose. However today (2020) it is pretty safe to go with version 3.x, with the latest stable version at the time of writing being 3.8.

### Installing Python 
Strart by downloading the latest version of Python 3 from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/). Install it as you would with any other software. To confirm that it was successfully installed open the Command Prompt window and type __python__ you should see:

```
C:\WINDOWS\System32>python
Python 3.8.3 (tags/v3.8.3:6f8c832, May 13 2020, 22:20:19) [MSC v.1925 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
