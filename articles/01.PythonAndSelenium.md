# Introduction and setup
In this series of articles we will go through all the steps needed to write a script that reads information from a website. Other articles in this series will cover:
* [02. Writing a basic selenium script to get information](02.BasicSelenium.md)
* [03. Optimising the script for performance and stability](03.Optimisations.md)

This article introduces the basic setup required to install the corect version of Python and the Selenium library. It also discusses the difference between a simple scraper and using Selenium
## Python and Selenium
The setup assumes a Windows operating system but should be easily transferable to Mac OSX or Linux.
### Python versions
Which Python version should one use: Python 2 or 3? This might have been a point of discussion in the past (Python 2.7 is the Latest version of Python 2.x and was released in 2010) since the two are not compatible, one had to pick a version. However today (2020) it is pretty safe to go with version 3.x, with the latest stable version at the time of writing being 3.8.
### Installing Python 
Strart by downloading the latest version of Python 3 from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/). Install it as you would with any other software. To confirm that it was successfully installed open the Command Prompt window and type __python__, you should see something like the following:
```
C:\WINDOWS\System32>python
Python 3.8.3 (tags/v3.8.3:6f8c832, May 13 2020, 22:20:19) [MSC v.1925 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
```
### Installing and using pip
pip is the package installer for Python. It is very likely that it came along with your Python installation. You can check by entering __pip -V__ in a Comand Prompt Window, and you should see something like the following:
```
C:\WINDOWS\System32>pip -V
pip 20.1.1 from c:\path\to\python\python38-32\lib\site-packages\pip (python 3.8)
```
If pip is not available, it neds to be installed by following these steps:
* Download [get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) to a folder on your computer.
* Open a command prompt
* Navigate to the folder where get-pip.py was saved
* Run the following command: __python get-pip.py__

The last step is to donwload the Selenium library (more on Selenium below) using the command: __pip install selenium__

### Scraping a website
* what is scraping?
* Scrapy approach

Selenium is a framework designed primarily for automated web applications testing. It allows developers to programatically control a browsers using different programming languages.
### Basic Scraper
### Basic Selenium
```python
from selenium import webdriver

#Open browser
driver = webdriver.Chrome()
#Visit Page
driver.get("http://www.python.org")
#Check title is as expected
assert "Python" in driver.title
#Find search field
search_field = driver.find_element_by_id("id-search-field")
#Enter search term
search_field.send_keys("pip")
#Find and click the Search button
search_button = driver.find_element_by_id("submit")
search_button.click()
#Look for expected result
link = driver.find_element_by_partial_link_text("PEP 439")
#Check the link is correct
assert link.get_attribute("href") == "https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0439/"
#Close browser
driver.close()
```
