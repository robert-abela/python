## Scripts and interpreters
A script is a sequence of instructions handled one at a time by an interpreter. The job of the interpreter is to understand the script instructions and communicate with the underlying Operating System (OS) to request the necessary services. As script developers you do not need to know how your instructions are handled by the OS. Most Python scripts can run on any OS without changing the script at all. When compared to an executable (compiled program), scripts are slower to run since syntax analysis and conversion to binary is done at runtime. 

## First Python script
The script below is the simplest script you can write in Python. Save it to a .py file and run it.
~~~python
print("Welcome to Python.")
~~~

## Variable data types
Variables are used to store different types of data in memory that can be referenced and modified in a script. Variables are given a descriptive name to make scripts more readable. It is helpful to think of variables as containers that hold information. Use ```type()``` to check the types of each of the variables declared.
~~~python
age = 30
print(age)
print(type(age))
~~~

### Integers
An integer (int) is a whole number, e.g.: 9. In Python 3, there is practically no limit to how long an integer value can be.
~~~python
age = 30
~~~

### Floating-Point Numbers
A floating-point number (float) is a number with a decimal point, e.g.: 33.65
~~~python
price = 9.99
~~~

### Booleans
A Boolean (bool) is a data type that may have one of two values, True or False:
~~~python
canRunFast = True
canJumpHigh = False
~~~

### Strings
A String (str) is sequences of characters. Strings may be delimited using either single or double quotes. All the characters between the opening delimiter and matching closing delimiter are part of the string.
~~~python
aString = 'Here is a string'
anotherString = "Here's another one"
~~~

## Naming your varaibles
Although there are very few limitations on what you can use as variables names, you should avoid meaningless names (such as x or i), names that are too long or cryptic names. It should be easy to understand what the varaible is used for simply by looking at its name. Naming conventions such as camelCase or snake_case also help with readability and consistency.

## Reading user input
For simple scripts it is sometimes useful to allow a user to enter some input. Strings can be read using  ```input()```.
~~~python
name = input('What is your name? ')
~~~

### Converting from string to numbers
Once you have a string from the user you can convert it to a number. Later in this course we will learn to validate user input.
~~~python
age_as_string = input('What is your age? ')
age_as_int = int(age_as_string)
~~~

***A Note on booleans***: ```bool('False')``` returns True not False. Read more on [Arbitrary Types Treated As Boolean](http://anh.cs.luc.edu/python/hands-on/3.1/handsonHtml/boolean.html).

## Working with variables
### Mathematical operations
~~~python
one = 1
ten = 15 - 5
eleven = one + ten
~~~

Can you guess what the following code will print out?
~~~python
number = 10
number += 5
print(number)
~~~

### Combining strings (concatenation)
~~~python
createdBy = "Python was created by"
guido = "Guido van Rossum"
sentence = createdBy + " " + guido
~~~

### Formatting output 
It is possible to print a number of variables at one go (separated by a space)
~~~python
seven = 7
twoAndHalf = 2.5
hello = "hello"

# This will work!
print(seven, twoAndHalf, hello)

# This will not work!
# print(seven + twoAndHalf + hello)
# TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'

#Fix 
print(str(seven) + str(twoAndHalf) + hello)
~~~

### Advanced output formatting
~~~python
print("Integer: %d" % seven)
print("Float: %f" % twoAndHalf)
print("String: %s" % hello)
~~~

Floating point numbers can be rounded before printing 

~~~python
print("%d %.2f %s" % (seven, twoAndHalf, hello))
~~~

### Task
Write a program that asks the user to enter the following and store them in appropriate variable types:
* The weight of a person
* ID number
* Telephone Number
* Address
* Date of birth
* Bank Account balance
* The height of a person
* A Maltese number plate

Finally print out all the varaibles you read

## Lists and similar structures

### Tuples
Tuples are a list of values e.g. the months of the year, and like other variables they are given a name. It is possible to access the items in a tuple using the index number starting from 0. In months 0=Jan, 1=Feb and so on. What is the output of the following script?
~~~python
months = ('Jan','Feb','Mar','Apr','May','Jun','Jul','Aug','Sep','Oct','Nov','Dec')
print(months[6]) 
~~~

### Lists
Lists are very similar to tuples, with the only difference being that the entries can be modified. Notice the square brackets instead of normal brackets below:
~~~python
toys = ['car', 'doll', 'ball', 'rope']
print(toys)
print (toys[2])
~~~

To add a new toy to our list, use the `append()` function. To remove a toy use the `remove()` function. We will be discussing functions later on in the course...
~~~python
toys.append('playstation')
print(toys)
toys.remove('rope')
print(toys)
~~~

### Dictionaries
Dictionaries group a number of keys to their mapped values and are mostly used to hold data that are related. Let's consider a cat named Pixel (who is male, 6kg and ginger):
~~~python
pixel = {'name': 'Pixel', 'weight': 6.0, 'color': 'ginger', 'gender': 'M'}
~~~
Curly brackets are used with dictionaries and a colon divides the key from its value. You can access all the dictionary or just one of the values by using its key:
~~~python
print(pixel)
print(pixel['color'])
~~~

## Libraries
Python comes with a long list of libraries and more can be added by the user. A library can be described as an extension to the language, giving the programmer new features. Let's say you want to print out today's date. You can create a complex script to do so, or you could use a readily available library. To use any library, you need make it accessible by **import**ing it. 
~~~python
import datetime
time = datetime.datetime.now()
print(time)
~~~
