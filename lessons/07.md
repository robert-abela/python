In this course we will be using text files which can have multiple uses:
* txt - Plain text file
* log - Common log files for events
* csv - Comma-separated values file uses commas to structure  data in a table format
* html, js, css - HyperText Markup Language file, JavaScript, Cascading Style Sheets (website code)
* json, xml - JavaScript Object Notation, eXtensible Markup Language are simple data formats

## Reading from a text file
The simplest operation is to open a file and read its contents. If you want to open a text file which is in the same directory as your python script (working directory) you just use the file name, else you need a full path. The sample below will print the file line by line:
~~~
f = open('file.txt')
for line in f:
    print(line)
fh.close()
~~~
It is important to close a file after you finish using it. The file might not be found, leading to a crash. This can be avoided by handling it properly as seen below:
~~~
to_open = 'file.txt'
try:
  f = open(to_open)
  for line in f:
      print(line)
  fh.close()
except IOError:
  print ("Could not open file:", to_open)
~~~
### Task
1. Open a text file and print only the lines that are on an even number, e.g. Lines 1, 3, 5, etc.

## Opening files in different modes
The open() function has optional mode parameter that specifies what can be done once the file is opened. Below are the most common:
* 'r' - reading (default)
* 'w' - writing
* 'x' - creating and writing to a new file
* 'a' - appending
* 'r+' - reading and writing to the same file

~~~
# open a file only for appending
log_file = open('my_file.log','a')
~~~

## Tasks
1. Open a text file and and count the occurances of every letter of the alphabet (both upper and lower case). Print out a summary at the end E.g.
~~~
A: 31
B: 30
C: 28
D: 14
E: 50
...
~~~
