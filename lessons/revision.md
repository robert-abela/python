# Revision tasks

Note: these tasks are mostly a selection of what can be found in [Simple Programming Problems](https://adriann.github.io/programming_problems.html)

## Basic Tasks
1. Write a script that asks the user for their name and greets them with their name.
1. Modify the previous script such that only the users Alice and Bob are greeted with their names.
1. Write a script that asks the user for a number n and prints the sum of the numbers 1 to n
1. Modify the previous script such that only multiples of three or five are considered in the sum, e.g. 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15 for n=17
1. Write a script that asks the user for a number n and gives them the possibility to choose between computing the sum and computing the product of 1,â€¦,n.
1. Write a script that uses loops to prints a multiplication table for numbers up to 12.
1. Write a guessing game where the user has to guess a secret number. After every guess the program tells the user whether their number was too large or too small. At the end the number of tries needed should be printed. It counts only as one try if they input the same number multiple times consecutively.

## Challenging Tasks
1. Write a script that prints the next 20 leap years. Hint: [algorithm](https://www.javatpoint.com/python-check-leap-year)
1. Write a function that tests whether a string is a palindrome.
1. Write two functions that compute the sum of the numbers in a list: using a for-loop and  while-loop
1. Write a function that rotates a list by k elements. For example [1,2,3,4,5,6] rotated by two becomes [3,4,5,6,1,2]. 
1. Write a function that takes a number and returns a list of its digits. So for 2342 it should return [2,3,4,2].
1. Write function that converts a normal sentence to a shouted one. So "Come here now" becomes "COME! HERE! NOW!".
1. Write a script that converts numbers to [Morse code](https://morsecode.world/international/translator.html). So 38 becomes "...-- ---..".
