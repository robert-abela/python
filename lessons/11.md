## Exit codes
The exit code in programming is a small number passed from a process to a caller when it has finished executing. The default exit code is 0, often meaning that there were no problems. When something goes wrong a non-zero value is used to exit, often different codes will be triggered by different problems. Most systems require it to be in the range 0â€“127, and produce undefined results otherwise.  
Our Python scripts can be called by a batch file (or other OS-specific srcipt). This batch file might be interested to know if our script was successful or not, possibly executing different commands accordingly. To specify an exit code in Python we use the following:
~~~python
exit() # defaults to zero
exit(1)
~~~

### Using exit codes in batch files
Some process calling your Python script may decide to take different actions depending on the exit code your script exits with. Consider the code at: [/src/lesson11/](https://github.com/robert-abela/python/tree/master/src/lesson11) where ```user_exit.py``` is exiting with different codes and ```test.bat``` is displaying different messages in reaction the script exit code being zero or not.

## Command line arguments
Command line arguments are parameters supplied to the script/program when it is executed. Command line arguments are an important concept in programming and are mostly used when the user needs to control your script. The partial output from a ```ping``` command  is given a command line argument of ```mysite.com```
~~~
ping mysite.com

Pinging mysite.com [50.284.231.75] with 32 bytes of data:

Reply from 50.284.231.75: bytes=32 time=69ms TTL=47
...
~~~
Command line arguments are passed as variables, as seen in the script below:
~~~python
import sys
print('Number of arguments:', len(sys.argv), 'arguments.')
print('Argument List:', sys.argv)
~~~
Running the script produces the following output:
~~~
python test.py
Number of arguments: 1 arguments.
Argument List: ['test.py']

python test.py arg1 arg2=value
Number of arguments: 3 arguments.
Argument List: ['test.py', 'arg1', 'arg2=value']
~~~

### Task 
Create a script called ```calc.py``` that takes 3 command line arguments: Num, + or -, Num. Use appropriate exit codes. Sample usage below:
~~~
python calc.py 5 + 5
5 + 5 = 10

python calc.py 10 - 5
10 - 5 = 10

python calc.py
Error: missing command line arguments

python calc.py 10 ? 5
Error: invalid command line arguments
~~~
