# Lesson 1: Introduction & Hello world

<!---
1. Explain an approach to programming to be able to solve common automation
problems, and how scripting languages fit into this approach.

1.1.Describe different paradigms for application development. 
1.1.1. Procedural. 
1.1.2. Functional. 
1.1.3. Object-Oriented.

1.2.Introduction to scripting. 
1.2.1. Using batch files. 
1.2.2. Using shell scripts. 
1.2.3. Scheduled tasks and cron jobs. 

1.3.Compare and contrast different scripting languages. 
1.3.1. Chosen language versus batch files/shell scripts. 
1.3.2. Chosen language versus other languages (such as Python/Perl/Java/PHP).

1.4.Prepare a workstation for Python development. 
1.4.1. Install Python. 
1.4.2. Install any libraries as specified by the lecturer.

## Scripting and Programming
[IEEE: The Top Programming Languages 2020](https://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/tech-careers/top-programming-language-2020)

Scripting languages: Python, Perl, Ruby, JavaScript, PHP  
Programming languages: Java, C, C++, C#

Main differences:
* Scripts are interpreted within another program (which needs to be installed) while programs are compiled into a stand-alone executable.
* An interpretor processes scripts are processed line by line while a program need to be fully compiled before running it. This makes it possible to execute a script even if parts of it contains errors.
* Scripts are delivered in human-readable text files while programs are binary files.
* Scripted languages are usually easier to learn, and scripts tend to be shorter. Programming languages are used for the more complex tasks.

### Batch files and Shell scripts
A batch file is script containing a series of commands to be executed by Windows. The term batch is from batch processing, meaning "non-interactive execution", however a batch file can include user input, conditions and loops. [This tutorial](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/write-simple-batch-bat-file/) will give you a good introduction to the power of batch files. 
~~~~
@ECHO OFF
TITLE This is my batch file
ECHO Welcome, this batch file lists all the files in this folder
PAUSE
DIR
PAUSE
~~~~
A shell script is like a batch file for Unix/Linux operating systems. Once a script is saved, it can be made to run automatically at specific times or in response to specific events using Windows Task Scheduler (or cron jobs on Linux). Scripts and scheduling combined are a very power tool to [automate boring stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/).

## Programming paradigms
Programming paradigms are used to classify programming languages based on their features. A single programming language can be multi-paradigm.
Paradigms reflect the style in which software developers approach their work:
* **Imperative** is an approach where the developer gives instructions to the computer
   * **Procedural programming**: instructions are grouped together into procedures
   * **Object-oriented programming**: instructions and the part of the state they operate on are grouped together in objects
* **Declarative** is a different approach where the developer declares properties of the desired result, not how to compute it
   * **Functional programming**: the result is declared as the value of a series of functions

## Installing Python 3.8
In order to run Python scripts at home you need to install the latest version of Python [by following this tutorial](https://datatofish.com/install-python/). Some notes:
* Python 2 and Python 3.
* 32 and 64 bit
* Using an IDE (e.g. [pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial) or [eclipse+pydev](https://www.pydev.org/))
