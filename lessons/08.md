## The network stack
![tcp stack](https://github.com/robert-abela/python/blob/master/src/lesson08/res/TCPStack.png)

The simple stack is made up of 4 layers:
* **Application**: Defines protocols and how programs interface with the transport layer services to use the network (HTTP, FTP. SMTP, etc.)
* **Transport**: Provides communication session management between host computers (client/server) using [TCP/UDP](http://microchipdeveloper.com/tcpip:tcp-vs-udp)
* **Network**: Packages data into IP datagrams, which contain source and destination IP (v4/v6) addresses. Used to forward the datagram between hosts (switching) and across networks (routing)
* **Physical**: Specifies details of how data is physically sent through the network (MAC address, cables, Wi-Fi)

## Client/Server (Browser/WebServer) architecture
![HTTP](https://github.com/robert-abela/python/blob/master/src/lesson08/res/client-server.png)  
In this model, a server provides resources (files, printers, etc.) or services (web, email, database, Active Direcotry, etc.) to one or more clients at the same time. When a client makes a request to a server (using IP+port), the server establishes a connection and communicates with the client using a specific **protocol**. 

### Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
An HTTP web server is a program that:
1. Listens for incoming HTTP requests
2. Handles this request 
3. Sends a response back to the client (normally a browser)
![HTTP](https://github.com/robert-abela/python/blob/master/src/lesson08/res/Basic%20HTTP%20Request_Response.png)

Every HTTP Response contains a status code ([complete list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes)). Below are the most common:
* 200 Success: OK  
Standard response for successful HTTP requests. 
* 401 Client Error: Unauthorized  
The request requires user authentication. 
* 403 Client Error: Forbidden  
The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it. 
* 404 Client Error: Not Found  
The server has not found anything matching the Request-URI.
* 500 Internal Server Error  
The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request.

## Web pages
~~~
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Page title</h1>
    <p>Some random content.</p>
  </body>
</html>
~~~

### HTML Forms
Forms are very common for logins, subscribing to a site, performing a search etc. A form is made up of a number of fields and at least one submit button. When the button is pressed, the information in the form is packaged into a HTTP Request and sent to a server for processing. Below is a very simple login form:
~~~
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Login</h1>
    <form  action="http://postb.in/kQ4BY46E" method="GET">
      Email:<br />
      <input type="text" name="email"><br />
      Password:<br />
      <input type="password" name="pw"><br />
      <br />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form> 
  </body>
</html>
~~~
### Task
The form above submits its contents to a disposable URL on [postb.in](http://postb.in) which expires after 30 minutes. Peform the following steps:
* Copy the HTML code above and save it to a local file.
* Create a disposable URL on [postb.in](http://postb.in)
* Update the HTML with your own URL
* Fill and submit the form
* Refresh your [postb.in](http://postb.in) browser tab to see what you just sent to it.

### CSS and JavaScript
Using only HTML will produce dull and pages that have very little use (and it will feel like 1995). CSS is used to prettify web pages while JacaScript is used to add functionality.

### Browser developer tools (F12)
![Dev tools](https://github.com/robert-abela/python/blob/master/src/lesson08/res/dev-tools.PNG)  
"Every modern web browser includes a powerful suite of developer tools. These tools do a range of things, from inspecting currently-loaded HTML, CSS and JavaScript to showing which assets the page has requested and how long they took to load. [This article explains how to use the basic functions of your browser's devtools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools)".
