In order to create our web server, we will need to import ```BaseHTTPRequestHandler``` and ```HTTPServer``` from the ```http.server``` module. With those two classes we would be able to listen to requests and respond with some HTML. We will also be needing the ```urlparse()``` function from ```urllib.parse``` to be able to understand the client's request, and respond with what it asked for.  
Normally a web server will respond with one of the following:
* Static content: load a file (html, iamge, script, scc, etc.) from disk and send it client
* Dynamic content: generate a response at runtime, e.g. read email on gmail, show the weather forecast, front page of CNN, etc.
