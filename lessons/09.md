In order to create our web server, we will need to import ```BaseHTTPRequestHandler``` and ```HTTPServer``` from the ```http.server``` module. With those two classes we would be able to listen to requests and respond with some HTML. We will also be needing the ```urlparse()``` function from ```urllib.parse``` to be able to understand the client's request, and respond with what it asked for.  
Normally a web server will respond with one of the following:
* Static content: load a file (html, iamge, script, scc, etc.) from disk and send it client
* Dynamic content: generate a response at runtime, e.g. read email on gmail, show the weather forecast, front page of CNN, etc.

## A First demo
The script below is a very simple web server that will respond with a hello to whatever you ask it.
~~~
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer

class MyServer(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header("Content-type", "text/html")
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(bytes("<html><body>Hello!</body></html>", "utf-8"))

myServer = HTTPServer(("localhost", 80), MyServer)
myServer.serve_forever()
~~~

### Some clarifications
1. **localhost** is a host name that means this computer. It is used to access the network services that are running on the host via the loopback network interface (127.0.0.1). We use localhost because MCAST restrictions will not let you run a server. If you want to listen on any interface, leave that string empty.  
1. **Port 80** is the default port for HTTP, if this is already n use on your computer you can choose another free port (e.g. 8080). From the browser you need to navigate to http://localhost:8080 in that case.   
1. **serve_forever()** will make your server run forever. You can stop it using Ctrl+C but it will produce a messy output (try it out)

## Using HTML from a file
In the sample below we are loading the HTML from a file instead of a hard-coded string.
~~~
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer

hostName = "localhost"
hostPort = 80
indexHTML = ""

class MyServer(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header("Content-type", "text/html")
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(bytes(indexHTML, "utf-8"))

try:
    html = open("index.html", "r")
    indexHTML = html.read()
    myServer = HTTPServer((hostName, hostPort), MyServer)
    myServer.serve_forever()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Start failed, index.html not found")
~~~
## Closing the server gracefully
As a further improvement, the sample below will handle the Keyboard Interrupt (Ctrl+C) gracefully.
~~~
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer

hostName = "localhost"
hostPort = 80
indexHTML = ""

class MyServer(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header("Content-type", "text/html")
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(bytes(indexHTML, "utf-8"))

try:
    html = open("index.html", "r")
    indexHTML = html.read()
    myServer = HTTPServer((hostName, hostPort), MyServer)
    myServer.serve_forever()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Start failed, index.html not found")
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    myServer.server_close()
~~~
