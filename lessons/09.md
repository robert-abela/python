In order to create our web server, we will need to import ```BaseHTTPRequestHandler``` and ```HTTPServer``` from the ```http.server``` module. With these two classes we would be able to listen to requests and respond with some HTML. We will also be needing the ```urlparse()``` function from ```urllib.parse``` to be able to understand the client's request, and respond with what it asked for.  
Normally a web server will respond with one of the following:
* Static content: load a file (html, image, script, CSS, etc.) from disk and send it client.
* Dynamic content: generate a response at runtime, e.g. read email on Gmail, show the weather forecast, CNN front page, etc.

## A First demo
The script below is a very simple web server that will respond with a hello to whatever you ask it.
~~~
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer

class MyServer(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header("Content-type", "text/html")
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(bytes("<html><body>Hello!</body></html>", "utf-8"))

myServer = HTTPServer(("localhost", 80), MyServer)
myServer.serve_forever()
~~~

### Some clarifications
1. **localhost** is a host name that means this computer. It is used to access the network services that are running on the host via the loopback network interface (127.0.0.1). We use localhost because MCAST restrictions will not let you run a server. If you want to listen on any interface, leave that string empty.  
1. **Port 80** is the default port for HTTP, if this is already in use on your computer you can choose another free port (e.g. 8080). From the browser you need to navigate to http://localhost:8080 in that case.   
1. **serve_forever()** will make your server run forever. You can stop it using Ctrl+C but it will produce a messy output (try it out)

## Using HTML from a file
In the sample below, we are loading the HTML from a file instead of a hard-coded string.
~~~
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer

hostName = "localhost"
hostPort = 80
indexHTML = ""

class MyServer(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header("Content-type", "text/html")
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(bytes(indexHTML, "utf-8"))

try:
    html = open("index.html", "r")
    indexHTML = html.read()
    myServer = HTTPServer((hostName, hostPort), MyServer)
    myServer.serve_forever()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Start failed, index.html not found")
~~~

## Closing the server gracefully
As a further improvement, the sample below will handle the Keyboard Interrupt (Ctrl+C) gracefully.
~~~
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer

hostName = "localhost"
hostPort = 80
indexHTML = ""

class MyServer(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header("Content-type", "text/html")
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(bytes(indexHTML, "utf-8"))

try:
    html = open("index.html", "r")
    indexHTML = html.read()
    myServer = HTTPServer((hostName, hostPort), MyServer)
    myServer.serve_forever()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Start failed, index.html not found")
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    myServer.server_close()
~~~

## Parsing the request
Finally, we will add code to check what the client actually asked for:
~~~
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer
from urllib.parse import urlparse

hostName = "localhost"
hostPort = 80
indexHTML = ""

class MyServer(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        request_query = urlparse(self.path).path
        if request_query == "/stop":
            exit()
        else:
            self.send_response(200)
            self.send_header("Content-type", "text/html")
            self.end_headers()
            self.wfile.write(bytes(indexHTML, "utf-8"))

try:
    html = open("index.html", "r")
    indexHTML = html.read()
    myServer = HTTPServer((hostName, hostPort), MyServer)
    myServer.serve_forever()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Start failed, index.html not found")
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    myServer.server_close()
~~~

## Task
1. Write an index.html page which uses another text resource (JS or CSS). In the page there should be a link to /list
2. Create a new Python module, mymodule.py, with a function list_files() that will list all the .PY files in a directory and produce HTML list as output
3. Create task.py which:
    1. Starts a web server on localhost:80
    1. Closes gracefully on Ctrl+C
    1. Responds with index.html by default (GET /) and is also able to load any resource it uses
    1. Responds with the output of mymodule.list_files() when the URI /list is requested
4. Extra tasks: 
    1. Make the file list show links to download the files
    1. Respond with a 404 if a requested file is not found
