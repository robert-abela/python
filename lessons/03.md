## IF statements (conditions)
The simplest control structure is the if statement, which executes code depending a condition being true or false. Every condition line ends with a colon. The statements that depend on the condition are indented (spaces or tabe). 

Condition | Description | Example
--- | --- | ---
**==** | True if the two operands are equal | (a == b)
**!=** | True if the two operands are not equal | (a != b)
**<>** | Same as **!=** | (a <> b)
**>**  | True if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand | (a > b)
**<**  | True if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand | (a < b)
**>=** | True if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, | (a >= b)
**<=** | True if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand | (a <= b)

Consider the following sample:
~~~
examMark = 68

if examMark >= 50:
    print("Pass")
else:
    print("Fail")
~~~

### Logic operations (and, or)
An if statement may be made of more than one condition, joined using:
* **and** if all need to be true
* **or** if at least one needs to be true.

Consider the following:
~~~
if balance < 1000 and age > 50:
    print("saving for retirement should be your only priority!")
    
if balance > 100000 or age < 25:
    print("retirement funds should not worry you!")
~~~

### Multiple conditions using Elif (else if)
~~~
if balance < 0:
    print("Trouble!")
elif balance == 0:
    print("Start saving")
else:
    print("There is something")
~~~
### Nested conditions
~~~
if destination == "MLT":
    if total <= 50:
        print("Delivery cost is 5 Euro")
    else:
        print("FREE delivery")
elif destination == "IT": 
    print("Delivery cost is 10 Euro")
else:
    print("Delivery cost is %.2f Euro" % (total*0.25))    
~~~

### Task: BMI calculator
Create a Python script that:
1. Asks the user to enter weight in Kg and height in Metres
1. Calculates the BMI using weight / (height * height)
1. Prints out the appropriate category according to the following ranges:
   * less than 18.5 = underweight
   * 18.5–24.9 = normal weight
   * 25–29.9 = overweight
   * 30-34.9 = obese
   * 35 or higher = extremely obese

## Loops
A loop repeatedly executes the same number of lines until some condition becomes false. An **infinite loop** is a script that that has some mistake which keeps it executing the same loop forever (or until we kill it). 

### While loops
While loops are made of a repeating condition. An if statement checks the condition once, a while loop will continue to check the condition until it becomes false (while it is true).

~~~
password = ''
while password != 's3cr3t':
    print('What is the password?')
    password = input()
~~~

### For loops

### Task: loop exercises
Write scripts as requested below using the while loops:
1. Ask the user to enter 5 numbers and print the total at the end. 
1. Ask the user to enter 3 names and print the longest.
1. Print out the the shape below.
~~~

Repeat the above tasks, this time using for loops.
