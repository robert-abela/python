## IF statements (conditions)
The simplest control structure is the if statement, which executes code depending on a condition being true or false.  
Every condition line ends with a colon.  
The statements that depend on the condition are indented (spaces or tabs). 

Condition | Description | Example
--- | --- | ---
**==** | True if the two operands are equal | (a == b)
**!=** | True if the two operands are not equal | (a != b)
**<>** | Same as **!=** | (a <> b)
**>**  | True if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand | (a > b)
**<**  | True if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand | (a < b)
**>=** | True if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, | (a >= b)
**<=** | True if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand | (a <= b)

Consider the following sample:
```python
examMark = 68

if examMark >= 50:
    print("Pass")
else:
    print("Fail")
```
In connection with data types from [Lesson 2](02.md), comparing different types might not result in what you expect:

```python
# flaot and int play well together
>>> 5 == 5
True
>>> 5 == 5.0
True
>>> 5 > 5.5
False

# bool is quite srict
>>> True == False
False
>>> True == 1
True
>>> True == 3
False
>>> False == 0
True

# string has its own set of rules as well
>>> "hello" == "Hello"
False
>>> 5 == "5"
False
>>> False == "False"
False
>>> "Z" > "A"
True
>>> "A" > "B"
False
>>> "a" > "B"
True
```

### Logic operations (and, or)
An if statement may be made of more than one condition, joined using:
* **and** if all need to be true
* **or** if at least one needs to be true.

Consider the following:
```python
if balance < 1000 and age > 50:
    print("saving for retirement should be your only priority!")
    
if balance > 100000 or age < 25:
    print("retirement funds should not worry you!")
```

### Multiple conditions using Elif (else if)
```python
if balance < 0:
    print("Trouble!")
elif balance == 0:
    print("Start saving")
else:
    print("There is something")
```
### Nested conditions
```python
if destination == "MLT":
    if total <= 50:
        print("Delivery cost is 5 Euro")
    else:
        print("FREE delivery")
elif destination == "IT": 
    print("Delivery cost is 10 Euro")
else:
    print("Delivery cost is %.2f Euro" % (total*0.25))    
```

### Task: BMI calculator
Create a Python script that:
1. Asks the user to enter weight in Kg and height in Metres
1. Calculates the BMI using weight / (height * height)
1. Prints out the appropriate category according to the following ranges:
   * less than 18.5 = underweight
   * 18.5 ... 24.9 = normal weight
   * 25 ... 29.9 = overweight
   * 30 ... 34.9 = obese
   * 35 or higher = extremely obese
   
### Conditions on list contents
Python makes it easy to check if a particular value is in a list or not:
```python
names = ['Jim', 'Jon', 'Tom']
if 'Jim' in names:
    print('Jim found')
if 'Jen' not in names:
    print('Jen not found')
```

## Loops
A loop repeatedly executes the same number of lines until some condition becomes false. An **infinite loop** is a script that has some mistake which keeps executing the same loop forever (or until we kill it). 

### While loops
While loops are made of a repeating condition. An if statement checks the condition once, a while loop will continue to check the condition until it becomes false (while it is true). While loops are preferred when we don't know exactly how many times the loop will be executed.
```python
password = ''
while password != 's3cr3t':
    print('Please enter the password: ')
    password = input()
```

### For loops
A for loop repeats the same statements for a known number of times, usually based on a counter. The example below will print 10 numbers starting from 0 and adding 1 on every step (0,1,...,8,9):
```python
for counter in range(10):
   print(counter)
```
If we need to start from another number, and increase in different steps we can use the following:
```python
for counter in range(100, 150, 5): # start, stop-1, step
   print(counter)
```
For loops can also be used on strings, lists, tuples and dictionaries:
```python
code = "369PIJKL"
for character in code:
   print(character)
   
cities = ['Istanbul', 'Barcelona', 'Florence', 'Venice', 'Nuremberg', 'Vilnius']
for city in cities:
   print(city)
   
pixel = {'name': 'Pixel', 'weight': 6.0, 'color': 'ginger', 'gender': 'M'}
for key in pixel:
   print(key, pixel[key])
```

### Task: loop exercises
Update your lotto script to use lists, loops and the condition above to make sure there are no duplicate numbers in the result.  

Write scripts as requested below using the while loops:
1. Ask the user to enter 5 numbers and print the total at the end. 
1. Ask the user to enter 3 names and print the longest.
1. Print out the shape below.

Repeat the above tasks, this time using for loops.
